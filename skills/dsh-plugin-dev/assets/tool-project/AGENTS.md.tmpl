# DSH plugin project entrypoint

Before substantive work, read these files completely:

1. `docs/agent/PROJECT_CONTRACT.md`
2. `TODO.md`
3. `dsh-reference.lock.json`

Use the installed `$dsh-plugin-dev` Skill for every DeepSeek Harness task and read only the references it selects for the active plugin surface.

Before dependencies are installed, run `node scripts/verify-dsh-context.mjs` before planning and add `--require-source` before implementation. After `pnpm install`, use `pnpm context:check` and `pnpm context:check:strict` normally. Stop and report a lock mismatch instead of developing against another Harness contract.

After moving the pinned Harness checkout or changing `DSH_HARNESS_ROOT`, run
`pnpm context:sync`; it rewrites the links and refreshes the dependency lock.
The environment variable alone does not rewrite package-manager links.

Preserve namespace named exports, runtime Config validation, declared service injection, caller cancellation, lifecycle-owned cleanup, real Loader coverage, and the source-linked publication boundary in the project contract.
