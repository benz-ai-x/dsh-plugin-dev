# Claude Code project entrypoint

Before substantive work, read these files completely:

1. `docs/agent/PROJECT_CONTRACT.md`
2. `TODO.md`
3. `dsh-reference.lock.json`

Use `/dsh-plugin-dev` for every DeepSeek Harness task. It is the same canonical
Skill used by Codex; this file contains no independent DSH policy.

Before dependencies are installed, run `node scripts/verify-dsh-context.mjs`
before planning and add `--require-source` before implementation. After
`pnpm install`, use `pnpm context:check` and `pnpm context:check:strict`.
Run `pnpm context:sync` after moving the pinned Harness checkout or changing
`DSH_HARNESS_ROOT`; it also refreshes the dependency lock. Stop on any lock
mismatch.
